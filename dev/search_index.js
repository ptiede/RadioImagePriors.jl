Samples from this produce matrices whose elements sum to unity. This is a useful image prior when you want to separately constrain the flux. The  α parameter defines the usual Dirichlet concentration amount.\n\nNotes\n\nMuch of this code was taken from Distributions.jl and it's Dirichlet distribution. However, some changes were made to make it faster. Additionally, we use define a custom rrule to speed up derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#RadioImagePriors.ImageSimplex","page":"Home","title":"RadioImagePriors.ImageSimplex","text":"ImageSimplex(ny,nx)\n\nThis defines a transformation from ℝⁿ⁻¹ to the n probability simplex defined on an matrix with dimension ny×nx. This is a more natural transformation for rasterized images, which are most naturally represented as a matrix.\n\nNotes\n\nMuch of this code was inspired by TransformVariables. However, we have specified custom rrules using Enzyme as a backend. This allowed the simplex transform to be used with Zygote and we achieved an order of magnitude speedup when computing the pullback of the simplex transform.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
