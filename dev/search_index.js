This can be simplified into the matrix equation\n\nXY ⋅ I = 0\n\nwhere XY is the 2×N matrix whose first for is given by X and second is Y. The space of centered images is then given by the null space of XY. Given this we can form a matrix C which is the kernel matrix of the nullspace whose columns are the orthogonal basis vectors of the null space of XY.
