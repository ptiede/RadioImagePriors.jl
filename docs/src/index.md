# VLBIImagePriors

This package implements a number of priors that are helpful when imaging VLBI data. These priors include commonly used Bayesian Stokes I imaging priors such as 
  - Log Uniform prior from [Broderick et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9c1f)
  - Dirichlet prior from [Pesce 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abe3f8/pdf)
  - Gaussian Markov Random Field (see [Markov Random Field Priors](@ref))

For polarized imaging we also include a number of useful priors that parameterize the unit n-sphere which are required to parameterize the Poincar√© sphere [Polarization Priors](@ref).

As of v0.8 `NamedDist` has been moved to HypercubeTransforms.jl. If you depended on it please load that package instead.

!!! warn
    As of 0.9 VLBIImagePriors requires you to load Enzyme explicitly for many AD operations since 
    rules will generically call into Enzyme as needed.
